# MovieReview
This project is a Movie Review and Movie Listing web application developed using PHP and MySQL. The main purpose of the website is to allow users to browse movies, explore categories, and search for specific movies through a simple interface.

The application is designed with two different user roles: regular users and an admin. Regular users can view movie content, while the admin can manage the movie database. All movie data is dynamically retrieved from a MySQL database.
